## 	What does this repo do in plain language?
This repo creates multiple data visualizations in jupyter notebook and then ultimately uses panel to display visuals in a dashboard. 
## What would you need to change to use it for a real company?
In order to use this for a real company, you would need to make it more accessible and change the data. While this method of running code does lead to a dashboard, it is unlikely that everyone in the company would be able to figure out how to do it this way. It would be better to have this dashboard as link to click on.
